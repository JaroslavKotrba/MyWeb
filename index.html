                        web sources. I love to work with R as the possibilities of data manipulation and reports
                        creation are endless.
                        In R there is a option to build own powerfull applications with the Shiny package that has a
                        special feature
                        of easily implementation forecasting models, in comparison to others softwares, which is a huge
                        advantage.</p>

                    <h2>Automation and Creation of Models with Python</h2>
                    <p>Python is definitely the best universal tool for data science. Creating and deploying of models
                        is really fun and the language is versatile. One can create a full working app only with Python.
                        My passion for python was developed through online courses and usage of vscode interactive
                        window. If making AI then
                        only with python! Python is able to create magical neuron nets that can solve almost any problem
                        in today's world.

                    <h2>Maintaining and Optimizing of Databases with SQL</h2>
                    <p>Automation elements and structure of a database is important for any business. With SQL language
                        one may create magic and optimize databases and so save time and money because to have a
                        accurate database
                        is a must nowadays. Excel sheets cannot bare so much data as is currently produced. SQL is
                        solution for big data
                        it is very compatible with other software and could be connected with R or Python for later on
                        analysis.

                    <h2>Visualization and Presetation with Tableau</h2>
                    <p>Tableau is a great tool to visualise analysed data, it helps to search for patterns and anomaly
                        in the data.
                        Also it is helpful fo visualisation geographical data. Projects could be build quite quickly,
                        when the pre analysis is done.
                        There are tons of features that can be used within the Tableau interface. The dashboards looks
                        not only amazing but also one can observe
                        essential correlations of causalities on interactive plots.

                <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
                <p>My name is Jaroslav Kotrba and I am a very energetic
                    person with an analytical mindset and excellent language skills
                    that are shaped and mastered through many international activities.
                    Besides, I am very passionate about working with data and its
                    visualization or transformation in an understandable manner. In the year 2020,
                    I wrote and defended my diploma thesis: "The Systemic Risk at the Mortgage Market",
                    which allowed me to unfold my skills in the data science area.</p>
                <p>My passion for numbers, modeling, and predictions led me to courses linked to econometrics and
                    statistics taught at the Faculty of Economics,
                    where I got acquainted with data analytics.
                    Then followed courses related to the statistics in computer science at the Faculty of Informatics
                    that were not compulsory.
                    However, I wanted to get a better insight and acquire more knowledge in practical data science from
                    real IT experts.</p>
                <p>The first working experience was obtained at the Czech Embassy in Vienna.
                    My tasks were to compile statistics related to the Austrian economy and
                    write summarisations on them accompanied by graphic elements predominantly sent to the headquarters
                    in Prague.
                    Writing about Prague gives me the opportunity to mention the membership in the Economics Commission
                    for National Economy,
                    where I discuss and elaborate possible changes, steps,
                    and recommendations for the government to stabilize and improve the Czech Republic's economic
                    situation. Nowadays,
                    I devote my time to work with software R/Python where I love to solve new problems and challenges.
                    As I do like R and Python very much,
                    I am very keen on dealing with SQL, HTML&CSS, Excel, or Tableau. I am currently working at Barclays
                    as Risk Software Developer & Analyst.</p>
