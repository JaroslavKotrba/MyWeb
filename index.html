                <p>I am offering services that consist of forecasting, cleaning and data scraping from different
                    web sources. I love to work with R as the possibilities of data manipulation and reports creation are endless. 
                    In R there is a option to build own powerfull applications with the Shiny package that has a special feature
                    of easily implementation forecasting models, in comparison to others softwares, which is a huge advantage.</p>

                <h2>Automation and Creation of Models with Python</h2>
                <p>Python is definitely the best universal tool for data science. Creating and deploying of models
                    is really fun and the language is versatile. One can create a full working app only with Python.
                    My passion for python was developed through online courses and usage of vscode interactive window. If making AI then
                    only with python! Python is able to create magical neuron nets that can solve almost any problem in today's world.

                <h2>Maintaining and Optimizing of Databases with SQL</h2>
                <p>Automation elements and structure of a database is important for any business. With SQL language
                    one may create magic and optimize databases and so save time and money because to have a accurate database
                    is a must nowadays. Excel sheets cannot bare so much data as is currently produced. SQL is solution for big data
                    it is very compatible with other software and could be connected with R or Python for later on analysis.

                <h2>Visualization and Presetation with Tableau</h2>
                <p>Tableau is a great tool to visualise analysed data, it helps to search for patterns and anomaly in the data.
                    Also it is helpful fo visualisation geographical data. Projects could be build quite quickly, when the pre analysis is done.
                    There are tons of features that can be used within the Tableau interface. The dashboards looks not only amazing but also one can observe
                    essential correlations of causalities on interactive plots.

            <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
            <p>My name is Jaroslav Kotrba and I am a very energetic 
                person with an analytical mindset and excellent language skills
                that are shaped and mastered through many international activities. 
                Besides, I am very passionate about working with data and its 
                visualization or transformation in an understandable manner. In the year 2020, 
                I wrote and defended my diploma thesis: "The Systemic Risk at the Mortgage Market", 
                which allowed me to unfold my skills in the data science area.</p>
            <p>My passion for numbers, modeling, and predictions led me to courses linked to econometrics and statistics taught at the Faculty of Economics, 
                where I got acquainted with data analytics. 
                Then followed courses related to the statistics in computer science at the Faculty of Informatics that were not compulsory. 
                However, I wanted to get a better insight and acquire more knowledge in practical data science from real IT experts.</p>
            <p>The first working experience was obtained at the Czech Embassy in Vienna. 
                My tasks were to compile statistics related to the Austrian economy and 
                write summarisations on them accompanied by graphic elements predominantly sent to the headquarters in Prague. 
                Writing about Prague gives me the opportunity to mention the membership in the Economics Commission for National Economy, 
                where I discuss and elaborate possible changes, steps, 
                and recommendations for the government to stabilize and improve the Czech Republic's economic situation. Nowadays, 
                I devote my time to work with software R/Python where I love to solve new problems and challenges. As I do like R and Python very much, 
                I am very keen on dealing with SQL, HTML&CSS, Excel, or Tableau. I am currently working by Honeywell as Data Analyst.</p>
